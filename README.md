# OWL2Go

OWL2Go is a code generator that takes a OWL ontology and generates a Go package which implementes a data model compliant to the input ontology and serialization/deserialization from/to Turtle/JSON-LD documents.

## Mapping

The mapping from OWL to Go follows the following table.

OWL construct | OWL expression (owl:..., rdf(s):...) | Go construct
--- | ---| ---
Class | Class A | `interface A`; `struct sA` implements `A`
 | | A subClassOf B | `interface A` extends `interface B`
 | | A intersectionOf B and C | `interface A` extends `interfaces B` and `C`
 | | A unionOf B and C | `interface B` and `C` extend `interface A`
Restriction (of class A) on Property B | allValuesFrom C,D; someValuesFrom; hasValue; xCardinality | `C`,`D`: allowed types; `E` := base type of `C`, `D`; `F` := common type of `C`, `D`; `A = {...; B() []E; SetB([]E)error; AddB(...E)error; DelB(...E)}`; `sA = {...; b map[string]F}`
Property A | domain B | add property `A` to class `B` as for restrictions
 | | range B | add `B` to allowed types of property
 | | inverseOf B | add function call to `AddB()` and `DelB()` in `AddA()` and `DelA()` functions and vice versa
 | | SymmetricProperty | add function call to `AddA()` and `DelA()` in `AddA()` and `DelA()` functions
Individual | type | create individual when creating model

## How to use OWL2Go

### Prerequisites

The ontology and all its imports must be encoded in Turtle format. The imports must be available through a http request.

### Usage

Go to cmd directory and execute the `main.go` with following arguments:

```bash
go run main.go <-f/-l> <ontology location> <module name> <path>
```

The first argument determines whether the ontology is stored in a file (-f) or available via http (-l). The second argument is the location of the ontology. In case the first argument is -f then this is the path to the ttl file. If the first argument is -l this is the url of the ontology. The third argument is the name of the Go module to be generated and the fourth argument is the path where the module will be generated.

Example usage:

```bash
go run main.go -l https://w3id.org/saref git.rwth-aachen.de/acs/public/ontology/owl/saref ../../saref
```

## How to use the generated package

We applied OWL2Go to the [SAREF ontology](https://ontology.tno.nl/saref/). The resulting module can be found [here](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/acs/public/ontology/owl/saref). The usage of the generated package will be explained based on this example.

Import the package:

```Go
import ("git.rwth-aachen.de/acs/public/ontology/owl/saref/pkg/saref")
```

To create a new model call the `NewModel()`function.

```Go
mod := saref.NewModel()
```

This will automatically create all individuals that are specified in the ontology. For each class defined in the ontology there is one `New` function defined for the `Model` type.

```Go
dev, err := mod.NewAppliance("http://example.com#dev1")
if err != nil {
    return
}
```

The `New` method takes the IRI of the object to be created as input. If the IRI already exists within the model, an error is returned. Otherwise the first return variable (`dev`) contains the created object which is of type `saref.Appliance` in the example above. Properties of an object can be manipulated by invoking `Set`, `Add` and `Del` functions:

```Go
err = dev.SetHasDescription("This is a test device")
if err != nil {
    return
}
task, err := mod.NewTask("http://example.com#task1")
if err != nil {
    return
}
err = dev.AddAccomplishes(task)
if err != nil {
    return
}
```

A list of all objects from a certain type can be obtained by:

```Go
dev := mod.Device("http://example.com#dev")
```

This functions returns all objects of type `Device` which start with the prefix `http://example.com#dev`. For deletion of objects from the model a `DeleteObject()` method exists which takes an object as input and deletes the corresponding object as well as all properties which are linked from or to this object.

```Go
mod.DeleteObject(task)
```

Instead of creating a blank model, it can also be created from a document which is encoded in Turtle or JSON-LD and compliant to the ontology. The function `NewModelFromTTl` expects an `io.Reader` object as input.

```Go
file, _ := os.Open("input.ttl")
mod, err := saref.NewModelFromTTL(file)
```

The same works for the function `NewModelFromJSONLD`. Existing models can be serialized to either Turtle or JSON-LD by using the `ToTTL` or `ToJSONLD` method of the `Model` object. The methods take an `io.Writer` as argument.

```Go
file, _ = os.Create("output.json")
mod.ToJSONLD(file)
file.Close()
```
